   "pathogens infect plants": {
    response: `Plant pathogens infect plants through several common pathways:

1. **Natural openings** – Pathogens enter through stomata, lenticels, or hydathodes.
2. **Wounds** – Damage caused by insects, pruning, wind, or tools allows easy entry.
3. **Soil contact** – Fungi and bacteria in soil infect roots through root hairs.
4. **Insect vectors** – Aphids, whiteflies, and beetles transmit viruses and bacteria.
5. **Water & air spread** – Rain splash, irrigation, and wind spread spores.

Once inside, pathogens multiply, block nutrient flow, damage cells, and weaken plant defenses.

  "tomato diseases": {
    response: `Common tomato diseases include:

1. **Early Blight (Alternaria solani)**
   - Symptoms: Dark spots with concentric rings on lower leaves
   - Treatment: Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb fungicide
   - Prevention: Proper spacing and air circulation

2. **Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)**
   - Symptoms: Water-soaked spots, white mold on undersides
   - Treatment: Metalaxyl-based fungicides immediately
   - Prevention: Avoid overhead watering, plant resistant varieties

3. **Bacterial Wilt**
   - Symptoms: Sudden wilting, no leaf yellowing
   - Treatment: Remove infected plants, sanitize tools
   - Prevention: Use disease-free seeds, crop rotation

  "soil fertility": {
    response: `To improve soil fertility organically:

1. **Compost Addition**
   - Add 2-3 inches of well-decomposed compost annually
   - Improves soil structure and nutrient content

2. **Green Manure Crops**
   - Plant legumes (clover, alfalfa) as cover crops
   - They fix nitrogen naturally in soil

3. **Mulching**
   - Use organic mulch (straw, leaves)
   - Retains moisture and adds nutrients

4. **Vermicompost**
   - Excellent source of nutrients and beneficial microbes
   - Apply 5-10 tons per hectare

5. **Crop Rotation**
   - Rotate heavy feeders with nitrogen-fixing crops
   - Prevents soil depletion

  "aphid control": {
    response: `**Natural methods to control aphids:**

**1. Biological Control:**
- Introduce ladybugs (eat 50-60 aphids/day)
- Lacewings and parasitic wasps
- Maintain beneficial insect habitats

**2. Organic Sprays:**
- **Neem Oil**: 5ml/liter water, spray weekly
- **Soap Solution**: 2 tablespoons mild soap/liter
- **Garlic Spray**: Crushed garlic in water, ferment 24hrs

**3. Cultural Methods:**
- Strong water spray to dislodge aphids
- Yellow sticky traps to catch winged aphids
- Remove heavily infested leaves

**4. Companion Planting:**
- Plant marigolds, nasturtiums (repel aphids)
- Herbs like mint, basil, rosemary

**5. Homemade Remedies:**
- Chili pepper spray
- Tobacco water (use cautiously)
- Tomato leaf spray

**Prevention:**
- Avoid over-fertilization (attracts aphids)
- Regular monitoring
- Maintain plant health

  fertilizer: {
    response: `**Fertilizer Recommendations:**

**NPK Basics:**
- **N (Nitrogen)**: Leaf growth, green color
- **P (Phosphorus)**: Root development, flowering
- **K (Potassium)**: Overall health, disease resistance

**Common Fertilizer Schedules:**

**For Vegetables:**
- Base: 10-10-10 NPK at planting
- Growth stage: Higher N (20-10-10)
- Flowering: Higher P (10-20-10)

**For Cereals (Wheat/Rice):**
- Basal: 50% N + 100% P + 100% K
- Top dressing: 25% N at tillering, 25% at flowering

**Organic Alternatives:**
- Compost: Balanced nutrients
- Bone meal: High phosphorus
- Blood meal: High nitrogen
- Wood ash: Potassium source

**Application Tips:**
- Soil test before application
- Apply in split doses
- Water after application
- Avoid over-fertilization

  irrigation: {
    response: `**Efficient Irrigation Methods:**

**1. Drip Irrigation:**
- Water efficiency: 90-95%
- Best for: Vegetables, fruits
- Benefits: Reduces water waste, prevents leaf diseases
- Cost: Medium to high initial investment

**2. Sprinkler System:**
- Water efficiency: 70-80%
- Best for: Field crops, lawns
- Benefits: Uniform distribution
- Cost: Medium

**3. Furrow Irrigation:**
- Water efficiency: 50-60%
- Best for: Row crops
- Benefits: Low cost, traditional
- Cost: Low

**Water Management Tips:**
- Irrigate early morning or evening
- Check soil moisture (finger test)
- Mulch to reduce evaporation
- Collect rainwater

**Smart Scheduling:**
- Sandy soil: Frequent, light watering
- Clay soil: Infrequent, deep watering
- Monitor weather forecasts
- Adjust for crop stage
